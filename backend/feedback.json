  "Posture & Physical Presence": {
    "Analysis": "The speaker maintains a relatively still posture. There are no noticeable gestures. The lack of movement could make the presentation less engaging.",
    "Recommendations": [
      "Incorporate purposeful hand gestures to emphasize key points.",
      "Vary posture slightly to maintain audience interest.",
      "Avoid stiffness by consciously relaxing shoulders and facial muscles."
    ],
    "Relevant Video Section": "0:00-0:07"
  },
  "Eye Contact": {
    "Analysis": "The speaker looks directly at the camera, which is good for a virtual setting. It gives the impression of direct eye contact with the viewer. There's no variation.",
    "Recommendations": [
      "If presenting to a live audience, make sure to distribute eye contact evenly across the room.",
      "Hold eye contact for 2-3 seconds with individuals to create a connection.",
      "Practice shifting gaze naturally to avoid a fixed stare."

    "Relevant Video Section": "0:00-0:07"
  },
  "Vocal Delivery": {
    "Analysis": "It is hard to analyze because the speaker is not saying anything. The background noise also makes it difficult to analyze. There is no detectable pace, volume, or tone as the speaker is silent.",
    "Recommendations": [
      "Vary pace and volume to emphasize key points.",
      "Speak clearly and enunciate each word.",
      "Practice vocal exercises to improve projection and tone."
    ],

  "Content & Structure": {
    "Analysis": "Impossible to analyze content and structure since the speaker does not speak.",
    "Recommendations": [
      "Outline the presentation with a clear introduction, main points, and conclusion.",
      "Support main points with relevant evidence and examples.",
      "Use transitions to create a smooth and logical flow."
    ],

  },
  "Nervousness/Comfort": {
    "Analysis": "The speaker appears calm, but this may be because they are not speaking. It's impossible to determine any signs of nervousness or discomfort from this still position.",
    "Recommendations": [
      "Practice the presentation to build confidence.",
      "Take deep breaths to manage any pre-presentation jitters.",
      "Use positive self-talk to reduce anxiety."
    ],
    "Relevant Video Section": "0:00-0:07"
  },
  "Summary": {
    "Overall Assessment": "The speaker is still and silent, making it impossible to provide a full assessment. The speaker appears relatively calm and composed.",
    "Actionable Steps": [
      "Incorporate purposeful hand gestures and movement into presentations.",
      "Practice vocal delivery to vary pace, volume, and tone.",
      "Outline the presentation with a clear structure and supporting evidence.",
      "Practice to build confidence and manage any potential nervousness."
