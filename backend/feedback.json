{
  "Posture & Physical Presence": {
    "Assessment": "Posture is somewhat relaxed but could be more upright to project confidence. You are seated, which limits body language, but more visible gestures can improve audience engagement.",
    "Recommendations": [
      "Sit up straight with your shoulders back, avoiding slouching. This projects confidence and improves breathing.",
      "Even while seated, use subtle hand gestures to emphasize points and keep the audience engaged.",
      "Be mindful of your hand positioning, avoiding fidgeting or distracting movements."
    ],
    "Timestamp": "0:00-0:13 (General observation throughout the video)"
  },
  "Eye Contact": {
    "Assessment": "Eye contact is present, but the angle and fixed position suggest you are primarily looking at the camera. More variation in gaze can create a more natural and engaging feel.",
    "Recommendations": [
      "Practice varying your gaze slightly while speaking, as if you're making eye contact with different individuals in the audience.",
      "Remember to blink normally, as prolonged staring can appear unnatural.",
      "Avoid glancing at yourself or your surroundings while recording, which can be distracting."
    ],
    "Timestamp": "0:01-0:07 (When showing the prototype, focus remains on the object, losing some eye contact)"
  },
  "Vocal Delivery": {
    "Assessment": "Your voice is clear and understandable. Pace is moderate. However, the speech lacks inflection and variation in tone, making it sound a bit monotonous.",
    "Recommendations": [
      "Practice varying your pitch and tone to add emphasis to key words and phrases.",
      "Incorporate pauses for dramatic effect or to allow the audience time to process information.",
      "Record yourself speaking and listen back to identify areas where you can improve your vocal variation."
    ],
    "Timestamp": "0:00-0:14 (Overall, the vocal delivery is somewhat flat.)"
  },
  "Content & Structure": {
    "Assessment": "Content is concise and to the point. The introduction of the prototype and the announcement of future parts create a clear structure.",
    "Recommendations": [
      "Consider adding a brief summary of what you've covered at the end to reinforce key takeaways.",
      "Plan your content in advance to ensure a logical flow and avoid rambling.",
      "Use visual aids (e.g., graphics, text overlays) to enhance understanding and engagement."
    ],
    "Timestamp": "0:02-0:08 (Clear presentation of the prototype and its current state)"
  },
  "Nervousness/Comfort": {
    "Assessment": "You seem reasonably comfortable, but the delivery could be more relaxed and natural.",
    "Recommendations": [
      "Practice your presentation several times beforehand to become more familiar with the material.",
      "Use relaxation techniques (e.g., deep breathing) to calm your nerves before recording.",
      "Try to view the camera as a friendly person you're having a conversation with."
    ],
    "Timestamp": "0:00-0:14 (The delivery is slightly reserved but generally comfortable)"
  },
  "Summary": {
    "Overall Summary": "You possess the fundamental skills for effective communication. Improvements can be made in physical presence, vocal delivery, and overall comfort to enhance your presentations further.",
    "Actionable Steps": [
      "Practice maintaining good posture and using gestures while speaking.",
      "Focus on varying your vocal tone and using pauses strategically.",
      "Prepare your content in advance and rehearse to increase your comfort level."
